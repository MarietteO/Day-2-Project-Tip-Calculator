<h3>Section 2: Day 2 - Beginner - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings</h3>
<b>Skills demonstrated:</b><br>
Function: <i>round()</i><br>
Type conversion<br>
Importing modules<br>
Calling classes, methods, and constants<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> Because I am not an actual beginner, I opted to use the decimal module rather than a simple round function to ensure proper rounding in this context. But if I were to use the round function, I would also use :.2f to ensure rounding to 2 places even if the decimals were 0.
